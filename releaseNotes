Project Release Notes: Group 8
Project Overview:
----------------
The Interactive Mapping Platform allows registered users to log in, register, and interact with a dynamic map interface. Users can toggle pin-adding mode to drop custom pins on the map. This project features user authentication, session management, and real-time map manipulation powered by Mapbox. Future iterations will support persistent storage of pins and multimedia content.

- User registration with validation
- User login with secure password hashing
- Session-based authentication
- Dynamic map integration using Mapbox GL JS
